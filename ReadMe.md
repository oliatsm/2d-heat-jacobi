# 2D Heat Plate Simulation on GPU

This project implements a GPU-accelerated simulation of heat distribution on a 2D metal plate using the Jacobi iterative method.

The serial implementation is based on the [OpenACC Training Materials](https://github.com/OpenACC/openacc-training-materials) provided by OpenACC.org  
This repository extends the original tutorial by adding a CUDA version for GPU acceleration.
